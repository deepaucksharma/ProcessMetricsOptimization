# NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization

A production-grade, **multi-layer** process-metrics pipeline built as a custom **New Relic Distribution of OpenTelemetry (NRDOT)** collector.
Its core mission is to **significantly reduce metric ingest costs (aiming for ‚â• 90% reduction)** by intelligently refining process metric data, while preserving deep visibility into the processes that are critical for operational insight.

The pipeline will achieve this by progressively **Tagging ‚Üí Filtering ‚Üí Aggregating ‚Üí Sampling** process metrics through a series of custom OpenTelemetry processors (L0 ‚Äì L3). This project begins with a foundational "Hello World" processor (Phase 0) and will incrementally build out the full "Opt-Plus" optimization pipeline in subsequent phases.

## Quick Start

There are two primary ways to engage with this project:

### Option A ‚ñ™ Standalone Go Demo *(Illustrative Example Only)*

This option runs a minimal Go HTTP application. **It is NOT the OpenTelemetry collector.** It's a very simple, standalone example to conceptually demonstrate how a processor might modify data, using the original `main.go` content.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nrdot-process-optimization.git
cd nrdot-process-optimization

# 2. Run the simple demo
go run main.go

# 3. Access in your browser:
#    ‚Üí http://localhost:8080
```

### Option B ‚ñ™ Full Dockerized OpenTelemetry Collector *(Recommended for Development)*

This option builds and runs the actual custom OpenTelemetry collector (which includes the "Hello World" processor) within a Dockerized local development environment.

Prerequisites:
- Docker Engine installed and running.
- Docker Compose installed.

Steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nrdot-process-optimization.git
cd nrdot-process-optimization

# 2. Build the custom OpenTelemetry Collector Docker image
#    (This uses build/Dockerfile and targets cmd/collector/main.go)
make docker-build

# 3. Start the local development stack using Docker Compose
#    (This uses build/docker-compose.yaml and config/base.yaml)
make compose-up

# 4. To view logs from all services (Collector, Mock Sink, etc.):
#    (Run in a new terminal or after detaching from compose-up if it wasn't run with -d)
make logs

# 5. When finished, stop the local development stack:
make compose-down
```

Local Development Stack Service URLs (when make compose-up is running):
| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Collector zPages | http://localhost:55679 | Debugging collector internals (pipelines, etc.) |
| Prometheus UI | http://localhost:9090 | Querying metrics (collector & custom) |
| Grafana UI | http://localhost:3000 | Visualizing metrics (login: admin/admin) |
| Mock OTLP Sink Logs | View via make logs | Verifying OTLP data exported by the collector |

## "Hello World" Processor (Phase 0 Deliverable)

The initial phase of this project includes a fully functional "Hello World" processor integrated into the custom OpenTelemetry Collector. Its purpose is to demonstrate:

1. The fundamental structure of a custom OpenTelemetry processor (factory.go, config.go, processor.go).
2. Loading and using processor-specific configuration (from config/base.yaml).
3. Manipulating pmetric.Metrics data by adding custom attributes.
4. Core self-observability:
   - Using the standard obsreport package for common processor metrics.
   - Emitting custom processor-specific metrics (e.g., counters, gauges) via go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric.

Functionality: As configured in config/base.yaml, the helloworld processor adds a hello.processor attribute (with a value like "Hello from NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization!") to every metric data point. It can also be configured (add_to_resource: true) to add this attribute at the resource level.

Key Self-Metrics (visible in Prometheus/Grafana via the local dev stack):
| Metric Name | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| otelcol_processor_helloworld_processed_metric_points | Counter | Standard obsreport: Count of metric points processed. |
| nrdot_helloworld_mutations_total | Counter | Custom metric: Total number of metric points modified. |
| otelcol_processor_helloworld_latency_bucket | Histogram | Standard obsreport: Latency of processing. |

## Local Development Environment Deep Dive

The make compose-up command, utilizing build/docker-compose.yaml, orchestrates a multi-container environment:

1. **Custom OpenTelemetry Collector** (otel-collector service):
   - Built using build/Dockerfile, which compiles cmd/collector/main.go.
   - Configured by config/base.yaml, which defines a pipeline:
     - hostmetrics receiver (collecting process metrics, CPU, memory, etc.).
     - memory_limiter processor.
     - helloworld processor (our custom component).
     - batch processor.
     - Exporters: otlphttp (to the mock sink) and prometheus (for its own metrics).
   - Its zPages are exposed on http://localhost:55679.
   - Its Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoints are scraped by the Prometheus service.

2. **Mock OTLP Sink** (mock-otlp-sink service):
   - A simple service that listens for OTLP/HTTP metric data.
   - It logs the received metrics to standard output, allowing developers to inspect the data processed and exported by the collector. View these logs with make logs.

3. **Prometheus** (prometheus service):
   - Pre-configured to scrape metrics from:
     - The custom Collector's telemetry metrics endpoint (e.g., otel-collector:8888/metrics inside the Docker network).
     - The custom Collector's Prometheus exporter endpoint (e.g., otel-collector:8889/metrics inside the Docker network).
   - Accessible at http://localhost:9090.

4. **Grafana** (grafana service):
   - Pre-configured with Prometheus as a data source.
   - Automatically provisions the "NRDOT Custom Processor Starter KPIs" dashboard from dashboards/grafana-nrdot-custom-processor-starter-kpis.json.
   - Accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Configuration Highlights

### config/base.yaml (Current - Phase 0)

This file configures the collector for the "Hello World" demonstration and local development:

- **Receivers**:
  - hostmetrics: Collects process metrics, CPU, memory, disk, network, etc., from the host where the collector runs. collection_interval is configurable.

- **Processors**:
  - memory_limiter: Prevents the collector from consuming excessive memory.
  - helloworld: Our custom processor, configured with its message.
  - batch: Batches metrics before exporting, configured with send_batch_size and timeout.

- **Exporters**:
  - otlphttp: Exports metrics to an OTLP/HTTP endpoint. In docker-compose.yaml, this is typically re-routed to the local mock-otlp-sink service. For actual New Relic export, NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY and the correct NEW_RELIC_OTLP_ENDPOINT are required.
  - prometheus: Exposes collector metrics on an endpoint (e.g., 0.0.0.0:8889) that the Prometheus service scrapes.

- **Service Pipelines**: Defines how data flows from receivers through processors to exporters.

- **Environment Variable Overrides**: Many key parameters (e.g., COLLECTION_INTERVAL, NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY, OTLP endpoint) can be set via environment variables, with defaults specified in base.yaml.

### config/opt-plus.yaml (Future)

This configuration file will be developed in later phases. It will define the full, multi-layer optimization pipeline:
hostmetrics -> L0:PriorityTagger -> L1:AdaptiveTopK -> L2:OthersRollup -> L3:ReservoirSampler -> batch -> otlphttp (to New Relic)
It may also include a "cold path" exporter for raw data (e.g., to Parquet/S3) for archival or deep analysis.

## The Optimization Pipeline (Future Processors)

The core of this project is the development of a series of custom OpenTelemetry processors designed to work in concert:

1. **L0: PriorityTagger**: Identifies and tags metrics belonging to critical processes (e.g., based on executable name or high resource usage). Tagged metrics can bypass or receive special handling in subsequent layers.

2. **L1: AdaptiveTopK**: Selects metrics from the top 'K' most resource-intensive processes (e.g., by CPU or memory). The value of 'K' can be dynamically adjusted based on overall host load.

3. **L2: OthersRollup**: Aggregates metrics from all other non-priority, non-TopK processes into a single summary series (e.g., _other_ process). This drastically reduces cardinality while retaining a sense of overall system load from less significant processes.

4. **L3: ReservoirSampler**: Applies statistical sampling (e.g., reservoir sampling) to the remaining long-tail of processes not captured by L0, L1, or L2. This provides representative insight into a subset of these processes without exporting all of them.
