# Development Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the development of the NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization pipeline.

## Contents

- [Developing Processors](developing_processors.md) - Guide for creating new custom processors
- [Processor Self-Observability](processor_self_observability.md) - Standards for processor metrics
- [Metric Naming Conventions](metric_naming_conventions.md) - Naming standards for metrics
- [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) - Phased development roadmap

## Development Workflow

The project follows a phased development approach, with each phase building upon the previous one. The implementation plan provides detailed milestones and technical plans for each phase.

## Coding Standards

When developing new processors or extending existing ones, follow these guidelines:

1. Adhere to the metric naming conventions
2. Implement proper self-observability
3. Write comprehensive unit tests
4. Document configuration options and behavior
5. Update the implementation plan with new features
