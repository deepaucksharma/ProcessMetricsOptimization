# Phase 5: Full Pipeline Integration - COMPLETED

This document outlines the tasks that were completed for Phase 5 of the NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization project.

## Project Status

All phases of the NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization project have been successfully completed. The project now has a fully functional pipeline with all four custom processors integrated and operating together:

1. **PriorityTagger (L0)** - Tags critical processes based on name, pattern, or resource usage
2. **AdaptiveTopK (L1)** - Selects metrics from the K most resource-intensive processes with dynamic K adjustment
3. **OthersRollup (L2)** - Aggregates metrics from non-priority, non-TopK processes
4. **ReservoirSampler (L3)** - Samples a representative subset of long-tail processes

## Completed Tasks

### 1. End-to-End Testing ✅

- Created comprehensive end-to-end testing script (`test/test_opt_plus_pipeline.sh`)
- Verified data transformation at each stage of the pipeline
- Measured and documented cardinality reduction (achieved >90% target)
- Verified critical process preservation
- Tested with various processor configurations and load scenarios

### 2. Optimization and Tuning ✅

- Fine-tuned processor configurations in `config/opt-plus.yaml` for optimal performance
- Optimized each processor for resource efficiency
- Implemented and validated Dynamic K for AdaptiveTopK:
  - Added host load detection using system metrics
  - Created load bands to map system load to appropriate K values
  - Implemented process hysteresis to prevent thrashing
  - Added configurable minimum and maximum K values

### 3. Documentation Enhancements ✅

- Created detailed documentation in `docs/architecture/pipeline_overview.md`
- Updated all processor READMEs with comprehensive configuration details
- Updated the main README.md to reflect all completed phases
- Enhanced Grafana dashboard documentation

### 4. Dashboard Development ✅

- Created comprehensive Grafana dashboards for pipeline monitoring:
  - Full Pipeline Overview Dashboard (`grafana-nrdot-optimization-pipeline.json`)
  - PriorityTagger Algorithm Dashboard (`grafana-nrdot-prioritytagger-algo.json`)
  - AdaptiveTopK Algorithm Dashboard (`grafana-nrdot-adaptivetopk-algo.json`)
  - OthersRollup Algorithm Dashboard (`grafana-nrdot-othersrollup-algo.json`)
  - ReservoirSampler Algorithm Dashboard (`grafana-nrdot-reservoirsampler-algo.json`)
- Added detailed metrics for each processor
- Visualized cardinality reduction effectiveness and cost impact

## Success Criteria Achieved

The Phase 5 implementation has successfully met all success criteria:

- ✅ The full pipeline demonstrates ≥90% reduction in process metrics cardinality
- ✅ Critical processes remain fully visible with all their metrics
- ✅ Pipeline performance is stable under various load conditions
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly
- ✅ Dashboards provide clear visibility into pipeline operation and algorithm behavior

## How to Use the Complete Pipeline

1. Run the test script to see the pipeline in action:
   ```
   ./test/test_opt_plus_pipeline.sh
   ```

2. Start the pipeline with the optimized configuration:
   ```
   make opt-plus-up
   ```

3. Monitor the pipeline through Grafana dashboards:
   - Access Grafana at http://localhost:13000
   - Explore the various dashboards to see the pipeline's performance

4. View the data transformation in the mock OTLP sink logs:
   ```
   make logs
   ```

5. Customize the pipeline by modifying `config/opt-plus.yaml`

## Next Steps

With the completion of all planned phases, the NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization project has achieved its primary goal of creating a custom OpenTelemetry Collector distribution that significantly reduces process metric data volume while preserving essential visibility into host processes.

Future enhancements could include:

- Additional processor optimizations
- More sophisticated adaptive algorithms
- Integration with other OpenTelemetry components
- Extended support for different metric types
- Performance optimizations for high-scale environments
