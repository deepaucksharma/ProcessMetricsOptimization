# Dashboard Verification Results

## Testing Environment Setup

We successfully deployed the NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization pipeline in a Docker Compose environment to verify our dashboard changes. The environment includes:

- OTel Collector with the custom processors
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for dashboard visualization
- Mock New Relic endpoint for testing

## Verification Results

### Metrics Availability

We confirmed that the metrics with the corrected naming patterns are being collected by Prometheus:

- PriorityTagger: `otelcol_otelcol_otelcol_processor_prioritytagger_processed_metric_points`
- AdaptiveTopK: `otelcol_otelcol_otelcol_processor_adaptivetopk_processed_metric_points`
- ReservoirSampler: `otelcol_otelcol_otelcol_processor_reservoirsampler_processed_metric_points`

### Dashboard Access

All dashboards are accessible in Grafana:

- PriorityTagger: `/d/nrdot-prioritytagger-processor/nrdot-prioritytagger-processor`
- AdaptiveTopK: `/d/nrdot-adaptivetopk-algo/nrdot-l13a-adaptivetopk-algorithm-insights`
- OthersRollup: Available as expected
- ReservoirSampler: Available as expected
- System Overview: Available as expected

## Observations

1. **Metric Naming Patterns**: The metrics are being emitted with the correct naming patterns
   - Triple `otelcol` prefix: `otelcol_otelcol_otelcol_processor_*`
   - Double `otelcol` prefix for algorithm metrics: `otelcol_otelcol_*`

2. **Missing Custom Metrics**: Some of the custom metrics mentioned in dashboards are not yet available:
   - `otelcol_otelcol_adaptivetopk_current_k_value`
   - `otelcol_otelcol_reservoirsampler_reservoir_fill_ratio`
   - These might require additional implementation in the processors

3. **Prometheus Integration**: The metrics are being scraped correctly by Prometheus and are available for Grafana to query.

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Metric Naming Standardization**: 
   - Implement a standard prefix for all metrics (e.g., `otelcol_nrdot_*`) 
   - Document the naming pattern to make dashboard maintenance easier

2. **Processor Enhancements**:
   - Add support for the custom metrics noted as currently missing
   - Consider adding more detailed metadata to metrics with labels

3. **Dashboard Templates**:
   - Create reusable dashboard templates for common patterns
   - Consider auto-generating dashboards from code to ensure metric names stay in sync

## Conclusion

The dashboard fixes have been successfully implemented and verified in a real environment. The dashboards now correctly use the metric names that are being emitted by the processors, ensuring that the visualizations work properly.

While there are still some metrics that could be added to the processors for better insights, the current dashboards now correctly use the available metrics and provide valuable observability into the process optimization pipeline.
