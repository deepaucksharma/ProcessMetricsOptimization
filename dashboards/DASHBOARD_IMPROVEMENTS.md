# Dashboard Improvements

## Changes Made

We have fixed all the dashboards in the NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization system to use consistent metric naming patterns and to work with the actual metrics that are emitted by the processors. The following changes were made:

1. **Standardized Metric Names**
   - Updated all metrics to use their proper prefixes:
     - `otelcol_otelcol_processor_<name>_processed_metric_points` for processor metrics
     - `otelcol_otelcol_<name>_<metric>` for custom algorithm metrics
   - Removed all references to non-existent metrics with `nrdot_` prefix

2. **Dashboard-Specific Fixes**

   ### AdaptiveTopK Dashboard
   - Fixed metric names to use consistent patterns
   - Replaced conceptual panels with real metrics
   - Added a panel for current K value visualization
   - Added drop percentage visualization

   ### PriorityTagger Dashboard
   - Updated all metrics to use correct prefixes
   - Fixed latency panel to use proper metrics
   - Added visualizations for critical processes tagged

   ### OthersRollup Dashboard
   - Fixed metric prefixes
   - Replaced conceptual rollup info panel with real metrics
   - Added visualizations for actual rollup ratio and statistics

   ### ReservoirSampler Dashboard
   - Fixed metric names to use proper prefixes
   - Added new panels for identity sampling rate
   - Improved reservoir fill ratio visualization

3. **Removed Conceptual Panels**
   - Removed all panels marked as "CONCEPTUAL"
   - Replaced them with panels that use available metrics
   - Adjusted panel descriptions to match actual implementation

## Improvements for Processors

For the metrics system to be even better, we recommend the following additions to the processors:

1. **Standardized Naming Conventions**
   - All processor metrics should follow a single, consistent naming pattern
   - Consider using `otelcol_nrdot_<processor>_<metric>` for custom metrics

2. **Additional Metrics to Consider Adding**
   - **AdaptiveTopK**: Add a metric for processes excluded from TopK
   - **PriorityTagger**: Add metrics with labels for different tagging reasons
   - **OthersRollup**: Add metrics for specific aggregation operations
   - **ReservoirSampler**: Add metrics for actual sample rate applied

3. **Consistent Labels**
   - Add consistent labels across all metrics (`process_type`, `reason`, etc.)
   - Consider adding version labels to track changes

## Testing Recommendations

To ensure the dashboards continue to work as expected:

1. **Metrics Validation Tests**
   - Add tests to verify that all metrics referenced in dashboards are actually emitted
   - Test that metrics have the expected types (counter, gauge, etc.)

2. **Dashboard Integration Tests**
   - Consider adding automated tests that validate Grafana dashboards can successfully query metrics

3. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to include all available metrics
   - Provide examples of how to query metrics for custom dashboards
