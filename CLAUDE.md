# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

This document provides specific context and guidelines for AI coding assistants when working with the **NRDOT Process-Metrics Optimization** repository. Its aim is to help the AI understand the project's goals, structure, current state, and conventions, leading to more effective and aligned assistance.

## 1. Project Core Objective & Current Status

* **Primary Goal:** To build a custom OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector distribution that significantly reduces process metric data volume (aiming for ≥90% reduction) for New Relic, while preserving essential visibility into host processes.
* **Mechanism:** A multi-layer pipeline of custom OTel processors (L0-L3) that progressively Tag, Filter, Aggregate, and Sample process metrics.
* **Current Status:**
  * **Phase 0 - Complete:**
    * A foundational "Hello World" (`helloworld`) custom processor is implemented and functional.
    * A robust local development environment using Docker Compose is established, including the custom Collector, Prometheus, Grafana, and a Mock OTLP Sink.
    * Standardized ports and service interactions are defined.
    * Core documentation (`README.md`, this `CLAUDE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, processor development guides) is in place.
    * CI for build, lint, unit tests, and basic vulnerability checks is operational.
  * **Phase 1 - Complete:**
    * The L0 PriorityTagger (`prioritytagger`) processor is fully implemented.
    * It supports tagging critical processes by name, regex pattern, CPU utilization, and memory usage.
    * Handles both integer and double metric value types for proper threshold comparison.
    * Comprehensive unit tests and benchmarks are in place.
    * The processor is integrated into the custom collector and verified to be processing metrics.
    * Standard metric `otelcol_otelcol_processor_prioritytagger_processed_metric_points` confirms processing activity.
  * **Phase 2 - Complete:**
    * The L1 AdaptiveTopK (`adaptivetopk`) processor is fully implemented.
    * It selects metrics from the K most resource-intensive processes.
    * Uses an efficient min-heap algorithm to identify highest-resource processes.
    * Provides foundation for future dynamic K adjustment based on host load.
  * **Phase 3 - Complete:**
    * The L2 OthersRollup (`othersrollup`) processor is fully implemented.
    * Aggregates metrics from non-priority, non-TopK processes into a single summary series.
    * Supports flexible aggregation strategies (sum, average) per metric type.
    * Preserves metric type semantics (gauge vs. sum).
  * **Phase 4 - Complete:**
    * The L3 ReservoirSampler (`reservoirsampler`) processor is fully implemented.
    * Selects a statistically representative sample of metrics from "long-tail" processes.
    * Implements Algorithm R variant for reservoir sampling.
    * Adds sample rate metadata to enable proper scaling during analysis.
* **Phase 5 - Complete:**
    * The entire optimization pipeline is fully integrated and validated.
    * All processors (L0-L3) are working together in sequence.
    * Comprehensive dashboard metrics and visualizations are implemented.
    * The pipeline is fully operational and ready for production use.
